# Machine-Learning-Statistics-Assessment-2019

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook looking into the Boston House Price Dataset, the project looks into this dataset and falls under the followiing main categories:

1. The datasets variables and a breif description of each.
1. A look at, what I considered to be the intersting highlights of the dataset.
1. A review of the environmental aspects of the dataset and what, if any, impact they had on the house price.
1. An investigation into the difference, if any on the house price of houses that faced the river against those that did not.
1. I tried to establish if it was possible to accurately predict the house price based on the number of rooms per house.
1. Finally, i used the keras package and the Tensorflow library to train a model using neural networks.

To run the Notebook, you must have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. You can install this using the [Anacona](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python Distribution. You can also view the Notebook in a static format using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

The notebook itself is called `ML & Statistics Assessment`.
